## Basic facts

### The Earth is very big...

Earth is home to 7.7 billion humans, including you. Our world is very big.

Now, the Universe is really a lot bigger.
Scientists today believe that there are at least 21 sextillion planets in the entire universe.
That's 36 zeros -- a lot of other planets!

Are there other worlds outside ours? Are there other living things in the universe?

When there are so many planets existing in the universe, wouldn't there be at least millions, if not thousands of planets that have lives on them?

There may be many, many living worlds outside ours. And those living things there, might travel!

### Historic UFO sightings

There has been many histories about non-human gods, and they might carry some (or all) truth in them.

There have been many UFO sightings in history, and quite a number of them have their accounts documented or painted. These are four very famous ones.

### Many people have seen UFOs

UFOs stand for "Unidentified Flying Objects". If those other worlds have a technology level higher than ours, would they travel to visit us?

Some people believe they have seen UFOs on Earth. Coming from space, or coming from under the deep oceans.

Throughout history, people have written about intelligent flying objects and have them drawn in paintings.

In modern times, many people took pictures of them, and you can find videos of them online. Some of these videos were officially released by governments as authentic videos.


### Why you should care

Humans are going to space and maybe they will see something new that applies to UFOs.


### What is special about UFOs?

UFOs are known to travel in ways not explainable in today's science.

* UFOs all travel without the flying structure we see today and do not use a form of propulsion we understand in today's science. For example, they do not have wings and are not seen to have engines or propellers or exhausts.

* Some UFOs can travel "transmedium", meaning that the UFO craft can travel between air and water without any splash or slow down or speed up.

* Some UFOs have been shown to travel in impossible speeds, where the same craft instantaneously appears in one place and then immediately show up in another.

* Some crafts have been shown to combine and split and even shape-change, all the while in the air without any visible moving parts.

* Some have demonstrated some sort of intelligence or telekinesis type of understanding -- the craft could "read your mind" and reach your destination before you can.
