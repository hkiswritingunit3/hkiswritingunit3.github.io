Answers for these questions are all below.


## Basic facts

### The Earth is very big...

Earth is home to 7.7 billion humans, including you. Our world is very big.

Now, the Universe is really a lot bigger.
Scientists today believe that there are at least 21 sextillion planets in the entire universe.
That's 36 zeros -- a lot of other planets!

Are there other worlds outside ours? Are there other living things in the universe?

When there are so many planets existing in the universe, wouldn't there be at least millions, if not thousands of planets that have lives on them?

There may be many, many living worlds outside ours. And those living things there, might travel!


### Many people have seen UFOs

UFOs stand for "Unidentified Flying Objects". If those other worlds have a technology level higher than ours, would they travel to visit us?

Some people believe they have seen UFOs on Earth. Coming from space, or coming from under the deep oceans.

Throughout history, people have written about intelligent flying objects and have them drawn in paintings.

In modern times, many people took pictures of them, and you can find videos of them online. Some of these videos were officially released by governments as authentic videos.


### Historic UFO sightings

There has been many histories about non-human gods, and they might carry some (or all) truth in them.

There have been many UFO sightings in history, and quite a number of them have their accounts documented or painted. Here are some very famous ones.

1. [War in the sky (Nuremberg, now Germany)](/articles/history-war-in-the-sky)
2. [Utsuro-bune (Japan)](/articles/history-utsuro-bune)
3. [Flame in the sky (China)](/articles/history-flame-in-sky)

### Modern UFO sightings

The Area 51, Roswell story is probably the most well known UFO story in modern times,
and you can find information about it everywhere on the Internet.

In this site we will focus on more modern sightings and ones that have very strong
proof.

### Why care about UFOs?

Humans are now increasingly travelling into space, and maybe they will see more UFOs.

More importantly, UFOs are known to travel in ways not explainable in today's science.

* UFOs all travel without the flying structure we see today and do not use a form of propulsion we understand in today's science. For example, they do not have wings and are not seen to have engines or propellers or exhausts.

* Some UFOs can travel "transmedium", meaning that the UFO craft can travel between air and water without any splash or slow down or speed up.

* Some UFOs have been shown to travel in impossible speeds, where the same craft instantaneously appears in one place and then immediately show up in another.

* Some crafts have been shown to combine and split and even shape-change, all the while in the air without any visible moving parts.

* Some have demonstrated some sort of intelligence or telekinesis type of understanding -- the craft could "read your mind" and reach your destination before you can.

The answers to these questions will change the way we know our world today: in all fields of science and possibly religion! 

It will open the possibility for mankind to travel into deep space and back!


## Questions and answers

Do people know about this?
* Some people do and some do not yet.
* Some suspect that the US government is hiding secrets from people because they don't want people to find out about this.

The US government has actually been secretly studying UFOs for many decades, with information only becoming clear now with declassified documents:

What was the first US government project on studying UFOs?
* [Project Sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Sign) was the first operated project for finding information about UFOs. The project ended in 1949 and succeeded by Project Grudge.

What is [Project Grudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Grudge)?
* Project Gruge was a project of the US Air Force to study UFOs. It was started in 1949 and
ended in 1951, succeeded by Project Blue Book.

What is [Project Blue Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book)?
* Project Blue Book is a secret committee that writes reports on UFOs for the US government. It started in 1952 as a sucessor to Project Grudge. It officially closed in 1969 but operated until 1970. 

What is the ["Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program" (AATIP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Aerospace_Threat_Identification_Program)?
* AATIP is the successor to Project Blue Book, started in 2007 and ended in 2012.

What is the ["UAP Task Force" (UAPTF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_Aerial_Phenomena_Task_Force)?
* UAPTF is the public successor of AATIP, started in 2020. In between 2012 and 2020, a governmental program succeeded AATIP but the name of the group is not publicly known.

What happened between Project Blue Book and AATIP?
* It was said that the US Air Force took the role of UFO investigation but without making any of the contents public.


## Last but not least...

I believe in UFOs and think that there are lives on other planets.

(You and I do not have to agree.)

If you are interested in UFOs, there are a lot more details that you can find. The information I have gathered for you here is just intended to get you interested in the topic -- there is so much more!

Ask your parents to help your journey into the UFO world. Or come look for me in Ms. Bedard's class in 712.

Hope you enjoyed this site. Thank you for checking out - bye!!
