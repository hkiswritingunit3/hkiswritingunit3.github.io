# Historic UFO sighting: Utsuro-bune

## Introduction

The Utsuro-bune (Japanese: 虚舟, 'hollow ship') was an unknown object washed ashore in 1803 on the eastern coast of Japan. This story was described in three different documents, including
Toen shōsetsu (1825), Hyōryū kishū (1835) and Ume-no-chiri (1844).

## Story

As described in Wikipedia:

    An attractive young woman aged 18-20 years old, arrived on a local beach 
    aboard the "hollow ship" on February 22, 1803. Fishermen brought her inland
    to investigate further, but the woman was unable to communicate in Japanese.
    She was very different from anyone else there. The fishermen then returned
    her and her vessel to the sea, where it drifted away.

The account described the "hollow ship" as:

* 3.30m high, 5.45m wide

* The upper part appeared to be made of red-coated rosewood and has transparent windows made of glass or crystal, covered with bars and clogged with some kind of tree resin.

* The lower part was covered with metal plates.

This type of ship has not been known in any historical account in Asia or in Europe.
Is this ship really from our world?

The lady that came on the hollow ship was around 1.5m tall, had skin of a very pale pink color, red hair and red eyebrows. No one understood what she spoke. So far, still human.

But had some unique characteristics that raise questions on whether she comes from our "world":

* Had hair elongated by artificial white extensions. The extensions may be of white fur or thin, white-powdered textile streaks. (This hairstyle cannot be found in any literature.)
* She wore precious, long and smooth clothes of unknown fabrics.

In addition, she carried a special box that she would not share with the fisherman.

It must have looked like this back then!
