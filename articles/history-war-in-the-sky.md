## Story

This event was printed in the newspaper in 1561, with a colorful illustration on what happened that day.

As Wikipedia puts it:

    [A]round dawn on 14 April 1561, "many men and women" of Nuremberg saw 
    [...] an aerial battle "out of the sun", followed by the appearance of 
    a large black triangular object and exhausted combattant spheres falling 
    to earth in clouds of smoke. 
    
    [W]itnesses observed hundreds of spheres, cylinders, and other odd-shaped 
    objects that moved erratically overhead. The woodcut illustration depicts
    objects of various shapes, including crosses (with or without spheres on 
    the arms), small spheres, two large crescents, a black spear, and 
    cylindrical objects from which several small spheres emerged and darted 
    around the sky at dawn.

Interestingly, "black triangle" space crafts have also been sighted in modern times. There are theories that a black triangle is a man-made spaceship, but there are also theories that the black triangle is a craft of a non-human origin.
