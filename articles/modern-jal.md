# Modern UFO sighting: Japan Air Lines Cargo Flight 1628 incident

## Introduction

In 1986, the flight crew of Japan Air Lines Cargo Flight 1628 encountered
three flying objects during its flight from Paris to Tokyo.

## Story

On November 17, 1986, Japan Air Lines Cargo Flight 1628 flew from Paris to Tokyo,
and went through Alaska. During their flight time in Alaska, the crew encountered
two unidentified flying objects to their left.

These flying objects rose from below and closed in to the plane, and each of them
had two arrays of glowing lights but their bodies unseen.
Captain Terauchi of the flight described when these objects came close, the cabin
lit up and that his face could feel their heat.

After these two aircrafts left, a third aircraft trailed the flight that looks
like a much larger disk-shaped UFO.

The sighting lasted 50 minutes and ended around the middle of Alaska.

This sighting experience was very well documented with transcripts, audio and radar recordings.
Initially, the US FAA announced that this was a UFO sighting, but soon after retracted it
without any formal explanation of the incident.

This is described at Wikipedia:

    the FAA [did] not have enough material to confirm that something was there",
    and though they were "accepting the descriptions by the crew" they were
    "unable to support what they saw".
