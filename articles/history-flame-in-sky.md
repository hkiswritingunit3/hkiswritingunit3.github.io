# Historic UFO sighting: Flame in the sky

## Introduction

There are many historic accounts in Chinese history about flying objects of unknown origin, but this one stands out for being how odd it is.

The incident of "flame in the sky" (赤焰騰空, "chi yan teng kong") describes a UFO
mass sighting in Jinling city (now Nanjing city) on 1892 November 17th.

## Story

As described by Wu Youru in his "tale of the red flame in sky" (赤焰騰空記) article :

    (清光緒) 九月二十八日，晚間八點鐘時，金陵城南，偶忽見火毬一團，自西向東，形如巨卵，
    色紅而無光，飄蕩半空，其行甚緩。維時浮雲蔽空，天色昏暗。舉頭仰視，甚覺分明，
    立朱雀橋上，翹首踮足者不下數百人。約一炊許漸遠漸減。有謂流星過境者，然星之馳也，
    瞬息即杳。此球自近而遠，自有而無，甚屬濡滯，則非星馳可知。有謂兒童放天燈者，
    是夜風暴向北吹，此球轉向東去，則非天燈又可知。眾口紛紛，窮於推測。有一叟云，
    是物初起時微覺有聲，非靜聽不覺也，係由南門外騰越而來者。嘻，異矣！

Translated into English:

    On (1892) September 28th, at eight o'clock in the evening, in the south of
    Jinling City, a ball of flame suddenly appeared, from west to east, it was 
    shaped like a giant egg, red but without no light, floating in the air,
    moving very slowly. 
    
    The sky was dim when the sky was covered by clouds. Raising their heads up
    and looking up, the sight is very clear for the no fewer than hundreds of 
    people standing on the Red Pheonix Bridge.
    
    After a meal's worth of time, the flame gradually furthered and diminished.
    Some people say it was a meteor, but meteors go fast in speed and disappears
    very soon. This ball of flame slowly came near from being far, since it appeared
    until it left, it did so very slowly, and cannot be a meteor.

    Some say it was a child's sky lantern, but during the evening the wind
    blew north, yet this ball of flame flew east, therefore it coult not be a
    sky lantern.

    Everyone has their on explanation but was hard pressed to find any logical
    explanation. 
    
    An old man said, when the ball of flame first came to appear, there was a
    very faint sound that can only heard in slience, and that the flame flew in
    over the south gates. Ha, how strange!

As we can see in Wu's illustration, the ball of flame is shown in the top right
corner. With hundreds of witnesses on the bridge at that period, there does 
not seem to be any logical explanation using today's science.

This incident was supposed to be the first Chinese illustration of a UFO!
