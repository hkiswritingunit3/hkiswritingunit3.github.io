# Modern UFO sighting: Tic Tac

## Introduction

The Tic Tac "FLIR1" video was the big breakthrough for UFO admission from the US government.

In November 2004, the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group encountered an unusal aircraft, then named the "Tic Tac" for its unusual shape, and was able to obtain multiple types of traces on its movement.

One video circulated the Internet since 2017, and in 2020, the US Department of Defence confirmed that the video is authentic and that the captured craft on video is indeed a "UAP" (Unidentified Arial Phenomenon).


## Story

Some time in 2004, when training on the California coastline, the USS Princeton Carrier Strike Group reported "flying objects" that acted like "ballistic missles" -- these objects can travel from an altitude of 60,000 feet to 50 feet above water in a second, with no sonic boom. This perplexed the radar operators so much that they restarted and recalibrated their radar equipment, to the same effect, for two weeks.

In November 2004, the USS Nimitz trained in the same area, having heard the reports from USS Princeton. Specifically, one of USS Nimitz's mission was to track this mysterious flying object.
Kevin Day, the radar operator, first spotted a group of flying objects that
were "too high to be birds", but "too slow to be airplanes".

David Fravor, commanding officer of the Black Aces, first made visual identification with this group
of flying objects. Then Chad Underwood was able to capture the video using radar and the FLIR (forward-looking infrared camera).

This exact video is now well known as the "FLIR1" video, and available on YouTube.

This video shows the "Tic Tac" flying object that is:

* 40-foot-long
* white in color
* has an oblong shape

The Tic Tac has unique flying characteristics that cannot be explained in today's science:

* There is no visible propulsion (jet, rocket) or exhaust
* There are no control plane surfaces -- no wings at all

Yet it can hover between 15,000 and 24,000 feet, and move around like no airplane today can.

In the words of Chad Underwood:

    The thing that stood out to me the most was how erratic it was behaving. 
    And what I mean by “erratic” is that its changes in altitude, air speed, 
    and aspect were just unlike things that I’ve ever encountered before flying 
    against other air targets. It was just behaving in ways that aren’t 
    physically normal. That’s what caught my eye. Because, aircraft, whether 
    they’re manned or unmanned, still have to obey the laws of physics. 
    They have to have some source of lift, some source of propulsion. The Tic Tac 
    was not doing that. It was going from like 50,000 feet to, you know, a 
    hundred feet in like seconds, which is not possible.

Subsequently, two other videos from the USS Theodore Roosevelt in 2014,
known as the GIMBAL and GO FAST were also put in the public.
They were confirmed by the US Department of Defence to be
"authentic" and of "UAP" (Unidentified Arial Phenomenon, the term used instead of UFO).
